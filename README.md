Hi, I want to build a product for colleges and universities to conduct practical exams efficiently and securely by building a product where students can write code, compile, and submit their practical exam paper easily without doing any cheating
the FLOW:

department will feed the papers for each semester exam and students will have to log in with their university roll number, then their exam will appear and will start at the set exam time! after the submission, department will get the submissions at their dashboard(the good thing is, the software would automatically can review the code submitted by the students and can give a brief report to department(admin) for each student, also the software will suggest a mark that the student could get by analyzing their code.

then the department can look into the reports and give marks to each student

students will get their results in their email or informed by the department!

deeply analyze the idea and give me a proper corporate product document.
also give me how can we built the software and also what are more ideas we can implement and improve!
tell me everything about the tech stack, libraries and all

please ask me questions if you have any doubt before proceeding!
